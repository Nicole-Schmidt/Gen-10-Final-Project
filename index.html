		<p>
			Niki's Cafe serves up all your favorite food with that special twist. The restaurant was opened in 2014 by Niki Schmidt after she decided that the world needed to try her food. Many of her friends and family would ask her to make items on this menu for every family gathering whether it was a graduation party, Thanksgiving or a family reunion. Come in, eat and join the Niki's Cafe family!

			Niki has won multiple awards for her food. Most recently the "Best Homemade BBQ" at the 2018 Twin Cities Condiment Connoisseur Convention.
